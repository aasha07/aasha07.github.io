### Career Goals

I am currently majoring in Pyschology with a minor in business. I have always been interested in  criminology/psychology and hope to work within this field one day. It is also my dream to own all or part of a business, whether it is my own or something I am passionate about. 

### Favorite Food
My favorite type of food to eat is Mexican and Italian. My favorite dish at the moment is chicken parmesian!

### Travel
I love to travel and my top favorite place so far has to be Mexico! I cannot wait to visit more places, as some of my dream vacations include Greece, Iceland, France, and much more.
